Next Steps:
* Make mock design
  * Simple card layout
  * 1 Header with 1 button for sidebar
* Make html and css (using templates)
* Test publish the app to make sure that it works.
* Figure out how to scrape the data for the backend
* Create an API layer with a mongodb
* Integrate the scraper with the database
* Integrate the API with the frontend

Design principles:
* bright and colorful
* lead to call of action
* fun to play with
* super simple
* no whitespace
* purple, gold, grey (http://html.adobe.com/edge/reflow/)
* 2 or 3 shades (choose)
* nothing is black at all
* thin font (maybe 2 fonts)
* dark and light font colors

Keep in Mind:
* Make mocks and desired interaction first
* Think about the 5 second user
* Make it absolutely beautiful, like stunning art
